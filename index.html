      <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as<br>
      interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents<br>
      by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>
      HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p><br>
